# A module in python can be used to hold the functions and variable to do a specific task helping to organized the code.

# game.py
# import the draw module
#import draw

# def play game():
#    ...

# def main():
    # result = play_game()
    # draw.draw_game(result)

# this means that if this script is executed, then
# main() will be executed

    # main()

# You could import and using the from command allowing the draw_game into the main namespace

# game.py
# import the draw module
# from draw import draw_game

# def main():
#    result = play_game()
#    draw_game(result)

# using import * will allow you to use all the files from the specified module

# An environmental variable PYTHONPATH can be used to specify additional directories to look for modules.
