n = 6
print('true or false:')
print(n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0)
# if one of them is divisible then it will return true.

# The True and False Boolean are also can be converted to numerical values.
# True = 1
# False = 0

print("True converted as an integer: %i" % int(True))
 # This shows us that boolean expressions are converted to binary operators
