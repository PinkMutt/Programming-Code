# Identifier

# Naming:
"""
    Classes - Start with capital letter.
    Private Identifiers - Start with the ('_') underscore as their first letter.
    * Don't use '_' as the leading and trailing character in an identifier. Python built-in types already use them.
 """
 # Avoid using names with only one character.
 # You can use underscores to combine multiple words to form a sensible name.
